VLM Image-Text Matching with CLIP Classification

This repository contains code for a VLM (Vision-Language Model) trained on a CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) objective for image-text matching classification.

What is a VLM?

A VLM is a type of AI model that can understand and reason about both images and text. This model uses a CLIP-based approach to learn the relationship between visual features and textual descriptions.

How it Works

This model takes an image and a text description as input. It then encodes both the image and text into a common representation space. Finally, it uses a classifier to predict the probability of the image and text matching. A score close to 0 indicates a low match probability (not matching), while a score close to 1 indicates a high match probability (matching).

Note: This repository includes only the code for the VLM model. The datasets mentioned (Flickr30k and Flickr8k) are not provided due to size limitations and potential licensing restrictions.

Getting Started

Clone this repository:
Bash

```git clone https://github.com/targetlakshya/Vision-Language-Model```

Use code with caution.

Install dependencies:
Create a virtual environment and install the required libraries using a package manager like pip. You can find a list of dependencies in the requirements.txt file.

Prepare your own dataset:
This model is designed to work with datasets containing image-text pairs. You can use a pre-existing dataset (like Flickr30k or Flickr8k) or create your own with appropriate formatting.

Train the model:
The code for training the model is likely in a file named train.py or similar. Update the script with your dataset paths and hyperparameters before running it.

Bash
python train.ipynb

Evaluate the model:
After training, use the provided evaluation script to assess the model's performance on a separate test set. The script is in train.ipynb .

Use code with caution.

Further Exploration:

Experiment with different hyperparameters for training.
Explore the use of pre-trained CLIP models as a starting point.
Integrate the model into a larger application for tasks like image retrieval or image captioning.
